# Xamarin/Microsoft tools in Academia (Research & Development)

In every profession one of the key factors in problem solving is for sure - experience. Pushing the age
limits towards younger kids and students gives them edge because of experience. 
In previous workshops about Xamarin.UITests and Xamarin.Workbooks it was shown how kids in early age can
participate in the work on real-world prjects. It was shown that with Xamarin tools it is possible to start
working even with 10 years old kids and with work on real projects with age of 14. In the early
age it is possible to start with documentation which can be done with Xamarin.Workbooks, while in later 
stags kids or young developers can start working on application testing (either unit testing and/or UI
testng).

All roles in academia, both lecturers and students work on various problems in reasearch and development, 
usually those problems are from today's hype buzzwords like "big data", "machine learning", but for rational
users this is only math and sience. One of the math fields that fits into those buzzwords is for sure statistics.
Academia works both with Descriptive and Inferential Statistics using tools like Statistica, MatLab, Octave,
Mathematica and programming languages like R and Python. The problem arising here is that it is difficult to
transofrm (port) solutions made with those tools to industry wide acceped programming languages like Java,
C++ and C#. Thus making R&D solutions difficult to apply in industry.

This workshop will try to answer "Why not C#?" (favourite question of one of the authors to researchers)
and will show some methodic principles how to help academic staff and students to grasp broad spectrum 
in the technology and start working on the real (open source) projects, through the demos of various tools
that resemble work with scientific tools. Methodology starts with business development analysis and research 
and continues with using tools and testing algorithms and hypoteses and for those highly motivated ends in 
designing and implementing the libraries.
